      <h2>11 / 10</h2>

      <p>"This movie isn't for everyone, that's true, but this isn't necessarily based on an age-value, but an experience-value. Mask of Light is a movie more so created for the FANS of the Bionicle series. It isn't impossible that somebody
        unfamiliar would enjoy the movie, but it does make it more difficult for them to really bond with the characters and the story line. Of course it would promote the toy line in SOME sense, that's only logical considering the movie is a PRODUCT
        of the toy line, but it does not revolve around that aspect. The character's features were altered to take on a more lifelike state, yet without straying too far from their familiar appearances that fans have come to know them by. As far as
        expressions go, the characters display emotion beautifully. The way that the masks were designed, as they were to suit the film, allowed for obvious expression that the actual toys could not replicate. Overall, the film was an excellent
        rendition of the Bionicle world + characters, amazing soundtrack, smooth flowing animation, and rich in design. Bionicle has been around for some years now. This movie didn't just POP UP from a new and showing story. Development of the
        characters + the legends has evolved greatly. If this movie had been made to COMPLETELY suit those unfamiliar with Bionicle, it wouldn't have been set in the time area that it had, or have gone straight to home video."</p>

      <h2>9.5 / 10</h2>

      <p>"This movie is amazing! It brings the world of Lego's Bionicle to life. The story takes place on the fantasy island of Mata Nui were two Matoran, Jaller, the Herald of the Mask of Light, and Takua, the Chronicler of Mata Nui, are on a
        mission to find the legendary 7th Toa, a hero destined to bring peace and prosperity back to the island. But Makuta, the enemy, has other plans for the island and releases creatures called Rahkshi to go and prevent the coming of the 7th Toa.
        The movie is has almost non-stop action. I guarantee you'll enjoy it."</p>
